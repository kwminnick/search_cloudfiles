search_cloudfiles

This project was created to allow Cloud Files users the ability to search.  There are
2 components to this project and lots of pre-reqs.

1. index-cf.py

This python script will extract the text from your cloud files files and store the
results in a cloud files container.  It will also run lucene on this container and
store the indexes into a local directory.

2. Web App
